Implemented non-breaking speed improvements on the methods
`~plasmapy.plasma.grids.CartesianGrid.nearest_neighbor_interpolator`
and `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.CartesianGrid.volume_averaged_interpolator`
for `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.CartesianGrid`. The new interpolators now
require that the grid axes be sorted, which is always true for uniform
grids. Added a new test to ensure this stays true.
