The ``[all]`` option when using pip_ to install `plasmapy` is now
deprecated and may be removed in a future release. Packages that were
previously optional (|h5py|_, |lmfit|, |mpmath|_, and |numba|_) are now
installed by default when running ``pip install plasmapy``. To install
all packages required for code development of PlasmaPy, instead run
``pip install plasmapy[developer]``.
