Separated ``plasmapy.analysis.nullpoint.null_point_find`` into
two functions named
`~plasmapy.analysis.nullpoint.null_point_find` and
`plasmapy.analysis.nullpoint.uniform_null_point_find` in order to
provide more clarity to the
user. `~plasmapy.analysis.nullpoint.null_point_find` will find
the null points of a vector space whose values are manually
entered.  `plasmapy.analysis.nullpoint.uniform_null_point_find`
will find the null points of a uniform vector space whose values
are generated by a function inputted by the user.
