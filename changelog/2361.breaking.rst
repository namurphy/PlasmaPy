Removed the |lite-functions|
for `~plasmapy.dispersion.dispersion_functions.plasma_dispersion_func`
and `~plasmapy.dispersion.dispersion_functions.plasma_dispersion_func_deriv`.
Instead, the performance of the original functions has been improved
by using a :py:`try` and :py:`except` block instead of having multiple
:py:`if` statements to check for preconditions.
