Providing a real number to the ``charge`` parameter in |CustomParticle|
will now result in a |InvalidParticleError| instead of a deprecation warning. Now,
``charge`` must be a |Quantity| with units of electrical charge. To
express the charge as a multiple of the elementary charge, provide a
real number to the ``Z`` parameter instead.
