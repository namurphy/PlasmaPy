Removed the following files from :file:`docs/api_static`\ :
``plasmapy.particles.elements.rst``,
``plasmapy.particles.isotopes.rst``,
``plasmapy.particles.parsing.rst``, and
``plasmapy.particles.special_particles.rst``. These files corresponded
to modules that were renamed with a leading underscore to indicate that
they are no longer part of the public API.
