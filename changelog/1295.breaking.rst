Moved the ``grid_resolution`` attribute from `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid`
to `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.CartesianGrid` and `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.NonUniformCartesianGrid`
separately. This fixes a potential future bug, because this attribute is only valid as written
when all axes share the same units.
