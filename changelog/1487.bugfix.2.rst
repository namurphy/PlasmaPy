Corrected the improper inversion of the electron temperature for the
non-bimaxwellian case for
:func:`~plasmapy.diagnostics.langmuir.get_electron_temperature`.
The electron temperature, and not the slope, is a fit parameter of the
curve used by
:func:`~plasmapy.diagnostics.langmuir.get_electron_temperature`,
so there is no need for the inversion.  The returned value is now the
electron temperature and not its reciprocal.
