Renamed the ``plasmapy.dispersion.dispersionfunction`` module
to `plasmapy.dispersion.dispersion_functions`. Both
of ``plasma_dispersion_func`` and ``plasma_dispersion_func_deriv``
are temporarily still available, but will issue
a `~plasmapy.utils.exceptions.PlasmaPyFutureWarning` and will be
removed in a subsequent release.
