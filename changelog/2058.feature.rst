Added a ``notch`` keyword option to `~plasmapy.diagnostics.thomson.spectral_density`, which  allows users to output spectrum over one or multiple wavelength ranges to correspond to a notch filter commonly applied to experientially measured Thomson scattering spectra. Changed the `~plasmapy.diagnostics.thomson.spectral_density_model` function to allow notch to be applied during fitting.
